# Blockchain Exploration Lab
- get familiar with blockchain, in particular, the Ethereum blockchain
- topics
    - MetaMask, wallet, account
    - Transactions and blocks, sending transactions
    - Ethereum nodes

## Lab Setup
- use `emulator_10`, it is for AMD64 machines, and there are 10 nodes on the blockchain network
- for sake of simplicity, the blockchain running inside the emulator uses the Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus protocol, instead of the Proof-of-Stack protocol used in the MAINET. The activities conducted in this lab are not dependent on any specific consensus protocol
- **EtherView**, a simple web application (`http://localhost:5000`) that displays the activities on the Blockchain

## Task 1: Setting Up MetaMask Wallet
- for the basic interactions with blockchain, we can use a wallet application, which manages our keys, and displays some basic informations

### Task 1.a: Installing the MetaMask extension
- browser: Firefox

### Task 1.b: Connecting to the Blockchain
