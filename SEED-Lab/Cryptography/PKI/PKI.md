# Public-Key Infrastructure Lab
- public key cryptography is the foundation of today's secure communication, but it is subject to man-in-the-middle attacks when one side of communication sends its public key to the other side, the fundamental problem is that there is no easy way to verify the ownership of a public key. The *Public-Key Infrastructure, PKI* is a practical solution to this problem
