# Transport Layer Security Lab
- data are transmitted over a public network unprotected, they can be read or even modified by others
- To achieve interoperability, i.e., allowing different applications to communicate with one another, these applications need to follow a common standard, *Transport Layer Security, TLS*. Most web servers are using HTTPS, which is built on top of TLS
- topics
    - Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI)
    - Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    - TLS programming
    - HTTPS proxy
    - X.509 certificates with the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extensions
    - Man-In-The-Middle attacks
- prerequisite: this lab depends on the PKI lab
